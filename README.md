# Remote Deluge

Provides quick overview of torrent information in Chrome for the torrent client Deluge. This is not on Chrome Web Store because refuse me publish it even I chaange the icon, name and description. You can install it by loading unpacked (Linux/Mac) or whitelist it through domain policy (Windows).

## Request for help

I develop this in my spare time, which is very limited. Pull requests will be gratefully accepted where possible.
